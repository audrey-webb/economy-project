## Google Trendsâ€™ Ability to Predict Unemployment and Inflation in the World & Testing the Phillips Curve

### Objective
This project focuses on the following two research questions: 

1) Does Google Trends data accurately reflects the unemployment and inflation rates in the world? 

2) Is the Phillips Curve accurate about the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment? 

### Method 
At first the data focused on the top four countries that google search "unemployment" the most. These countries are the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Ireland. Due to the lack of data on Ireland's inflation, the sixth country that google searches "unemployment" the most was chosen--New Zealand. Similarily Nigeria, the fifth highest country, was not analyzed due to insufficient data. Now, the data used for analysis are the four countries--United States, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. Data is limitted to years 2006 to 2013 as they contain the most data.

### File Organization 
Information is organized through the creation of code, data, images, rawdata, report, and resources subdirectories of the Project directory. Inside of the data and rawdata subdirectories, we created two new subdirectories titled "Google" and "World Bank". Inside of each, there are two separate folders titled "Inflation" and "Unemployment". This kept the data organized as it was cleaned and analyzed. For example, the raw data concerning the United States Google Trends on inflation would go into the rawdata subdirectory, then the "Google" folder, and then the "Inflation" folder.

We give license for our code to be shared.
