Title: Google Trendsâ€™ Ability to Predict Unemployment andInflation in the World & Testing the Phillips Curve

The project focuses on two research questions.

The first question is whether Google Trends data accurately reflects the unemployment and inflation rates in the world. The second question is whether the Phillips Curve (which states that decreased unemployment in an economy will correlate with higher rates of inflation) is accurate about the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. At first the data focused on the top four countries that google search "unemployment" the most. These countries are the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Ireland. Due to the lack of data on Ireland's inflation, we chose the sixth country that google searches "unemployment" the most--New Zealand. Nigeria, being the fifth highest country, was also an option, but we chose not to analyze it due to insufficient data. The data now focuses on these four countries--United States, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. Data is limitted to years 2006 to 2013 as they contain the most data.

The authors of this project are Audrey Webb, Victor Yoolim Jin, Arion Thai, and Mehma Bhasin..

Data is organized through the creation of code, data, images, rawdata, report, and resources subdirectories of the Project directory. Inside of the data and rawdata subdirectories, we created two new subdirectories titled "Google" and "World Bank". Inside of each, we created two separate folders titled "Inflation" and "Unemployment". This kept the data organized as it was cleaned and analyzed. For example, the raw data concerning the United States Google Trends on inflation would go into the rawdata subdirectory, then the "Google" folder, and then the "Inflation" folder.
